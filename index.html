<h3><i>About Me</i></h3>

	<p>
	I was born and raised in the Chicagoland area, more specifically Naperville, Illinois. I have lived there for most of my life but love to travel. I am 22 years old and have a dog named Max. </p>

He's an Alaskan Shepherd and loves the cold weather (a contrast to myself). I make it a point to take a vacation each year, typically to somewhere on the West Coast. Las Vegas is a frequent stop for myself but I do enjoy visiting California and Arizona as well.</p>
